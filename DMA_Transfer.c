/**
 * DMA Transfer (Tx)
 *
 * We have a network interface ASIC that can DMA packets directly to/from our
 * RAM to/from the Ethernet. It is controlled by 4 memory mapped registers all
 * 4 bytes (one word) wide (see registers map below). The block can be accessed
 * from 0xd000000.
 *
 * The first register is the control register and is at offset 0x0.
 *   - Bit 0 controls the direction of the transfer (1=Tx, 0=Rx).
 *   - Bit 1 is the Go bit, setting it to 1 sets the DMA controller into
 *     action, either DMAâ€™ing data from our memory out onto the Ethernet or
 *     ready to DMA data from the Ethernet into our memory and the specified
 *     address.
 *   - Bit 31 is the reset bit. Setting it to 1 causes the controller to reset
 *     to a known state (i.e. ready to go). The bit will be cleared when reset
 *     iscomplete.
 *
 * The second register is at offset 0x4 and is the address register. Write the
 * RAM address here for the location of a buffer to be transferred out or ready
 * to have data transferred into.
 *
 * The third register is at offset 0x8 and is the length register. Program the
 * length of data to transfer out of our memory (Tx) or the size of the buffer
 * available to receive data from the Ethernet.
 *
 * The forth register at offset 0xc is the status register.
 *   - Bits 0:3 contain the status of the transfer where 0 indicates a
 *     successful transfer and non-zero indicates some form of error. The exact
 *     codes are not important for the context of this question.
 *   - Bit 31 contains the complete bit. It will be set to 1 when the transfer
 *     completes. It is automatically cleared when the Go bit in the Control
 *     register is set to begin a transfer.
